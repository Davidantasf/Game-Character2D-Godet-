# Game-Character2D-Godet-
Saving a script of a 2D character game that I was desenvolving in Godet Game Engine. 
I'm new to game design, decided to start with Godet Game Engine and researched a lot to learn how to use and create games.  
I don't know much about game scheduling, but I managed to get a head start and a good result.
I'm making available the files I used, the script and sprites of the character.
